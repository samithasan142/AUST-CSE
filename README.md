# AUST-CSE

Welcome to my "AUST CSE" repository! This is a comprehensive collection of all the theory and lab materials from my computer science and engineering program at Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology. Throughout my 8 semesters of study, I have gathered a wealth of knowledge and experience, and I wanted to create a centralized location to share these resources with others who may be pursuing a similar degree.

Within this repository, you will find lecture notes, assignments, lab exercises, and other materials organized by course and semester. I believe that this collection will be a valuable resource for current and future AUST CSE students, as well as anyone else interested in computer science and engineering.

Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to this repository. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Thank you for visiting!
